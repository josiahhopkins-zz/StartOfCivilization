    1.5 Hoarding by Humans

    15 Drink at river tile/ water threshold
    3 Data gathering

Additional TODO:
    Alter env for accurate flooding. IE more of a delta with streams that dry as the water table goes down.
    Break up the following functions:
        Automata
        all the "update"s
        all the "chooseMove"s
    Add more variance? (More randomness or encourage bet hedging)
    Better data collection
        Snapshots? Sampling? How to do so without eating up all the processing?
